# Make sure git is installed correctly
If you have github desktop installed, you might not have git installed as a separate package so it is important to make sure git is correctly installed. This a can be done using the following command
```
git --version
```
If the command outputs a version, then you're all set. but if you get nothing or an error then you have to install git properly.
